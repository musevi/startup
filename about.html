          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Accountability is a website meant to boost motivation and productivity among friends. 
            We’ve all been in a situation where we weren’t as productive as we could have been. 
            Maybe you set a deadline to finish something but didn’t reach your goal because Netflix was more enticing. 
            After all, no one else was holding you to your commitment. Accountability seeks to help you realize your 
            goals by making you accountable to your peers.</p>

            <p>When you make a goal in Accountability, you set a specific benchmark for yourself, a date to complete it by, 
              an "accountability buddy" and a monetary penalty. If you complete your goal before the deadline, your goal 
              is logged in your Goal Log and the penalty disappears. If you don't complete your goal on time, you owe 
              your friend the penalty you set!
            </p>

            <p>
              Hopefully, Accountability adds just the right amount of healthy pressure you need to finish your goals 
              on time while making it a fun way to interact with your friends. Cheer for each other together, and don't 
              forget to celebrate when you reach your goals!
            </p>
