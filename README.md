# Acountability

## Design

We’ve all been in a situation where we weren’t as productive as we could have been. Maybe you set a deadline to finish something but didn’t reach your goal because Netflix was more enticing. After all, no one else was holding you to your commitment. Enter Accountability, a peer-to-peer website where you share your goals with a friend, along with a monetary penalty. If you don’t complete your goal by the deadline, you owe your friend the penalty you set!!
